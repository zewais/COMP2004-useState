//NOTE: This is a bad way to implement a counter in React.
//This is because the count variable is not stored in the state of the component.
//This means that the component will not re-render when the count variable is updated.
//This is why the count variable is not displayed in the UI when it is updated.
//This is why we should always use the state of the component to store the data that needs to be displayed in the UI.
